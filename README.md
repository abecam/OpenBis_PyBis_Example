# OpenBis_PyBis_Example

A simple example of various usages of the PyBis API for OpenBIS ( [PyBis](https://pypi.org/project/PyBIS/) )

The Jupyter Lab example is mostly the same as the Python Script, but the Python script defines 2 helpers classes for writing and reading. 

pyBis needs to be installed first: `pip install --upgrade pybis`
